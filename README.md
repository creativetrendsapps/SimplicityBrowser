# FolioforFacebook

This is the source for Folio Free.

This repo will be updated as much as possbile.

Please create a Facebook app on Facebooks development portal, if you'd like the ability for users to login with Facebook. If you'd like to enable ads please create an AdBuddiz developer account. Some of the themes were removed and will have to be added by you if you choose to fork the project.

# Update:
6/15/16 This update converts most all of the drawables used in Folio to vector drawables. This reduces the apps size and also helps with scaling images for different screen resolutions better.
